                        My final project is a fitness application that can be used by two types of users, clients and trainers. Users looking to be more health conscious can register as a client. Once a client registers, they will be navigated to a profile page where they can input height, weight, and weight goals. Clients can search recipes and view the ingredients, instructions, and nutrition facts for recipes that cater to their nutritional goals. They can comment on the recipes and favorite them for future reference. They can also connect with trainers in order to view workout plans and ask specific questions about fitness or nutrition. They can follow the trainers so that they can view their profile easily.
                        Fitness professionals can register as trainers. Trainers will also be navigated to a profile page where they can view their workouts and see clients who are following them. Trainers can create workout plans and contact clients to potentially personally train.
